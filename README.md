# Managing-Threat-Intelligence-with-Cortex-XSOAR

## Overview
In this project,  I use Cortex XSOAR to investigate and hunt real-world threats
I work with Cortex XSOARâ€™s Threat Intelligence Management, with a focus on investigating and hunting real-world threats. I worked hands-on with Cortex XSOAR to consolidate multiple threat intelligence feeds, enrich Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), and streamline incident response workflows, enhancing both efficiency and effectiveness. I developed practical skills in automated threat intelligence management and incident response within a dynamic, cloud-based environment. 

## Objectives
In this project, I work on the following Cortex tools:
XSOAR Marketplace & Integrations
XSOAR Dashboards & Incidents
XSOAR Playbooks
XSOAR EDL Generation
